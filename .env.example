# Notes:
# - Rename this file to .env (or load it with python-dotenv) to provide runtime keys.
# - Keep your real .env out of version control. Add ".env" to .gitignore if it is not already ignored.
# - If you prefer different environment variable names (e.g., camelCase), update the code to read those names instead of the ones above.
